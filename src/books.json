To her it was fascinating watching the bees busily collecting the nectar that flowed out of the Pears that were overripe and fell to the ground. Once they had been blossoms that the bees pollenated to become the pears that some were picked to get canned and some were made into pear butter. Some, to be eaten fresh. Margaret thought and visualized the families that would be intertwined by the Pear tree that was to become their stories in her book called The Bee Tree and how it was the connection and representing the Tree of their lives. and becoming a planting ground for a story that would some day be shared with not only her own fami1ly, but shared with the World."}]
